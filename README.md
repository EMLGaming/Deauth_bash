# deauth
This is a fast script to deauth a network or target with a built in oui lookup tool. If you need any help on running the script just double click the file and the first few lines will explain. I would not download it right now beacouse i'm adding a option to deauthenticate everyone at the same time.

Disclaimer this can be used illigaly and i don't condone that.
