This is a fast script to deauth all around you, a network or a target with a built in oui lookup tool. 

**If you downloaded the script before monday 22th of may 2017, I would recommend to download it again because of all the changes.**

How to run the script:
1. First you download the "deauth.sh" and "deauthall.sh" (can be done however you want gitclone, or just via site)
2. You give the script permission to run by typing: "chmod +x deauth.sh" and chmod +x deauthall.sh"
3. You run the script by typing `./deauth.sh`
4. Have fun

*Disclaimer: this can be used illegally, but I don't condone that.*
